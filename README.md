# Suicide rate prediction ML model using Multivariate Linear Regression

## Prerequisites

* Conda
* Jupyter Notebook


### Dependencies

![Dependencies](https://github.com/CSharpTeoMan911/Suicide-Rate-Prediction-ML-Model/assets/87245086/580c65b4-de50-44e5-be8e-9e4581af9f8a)

<br>

* Pandas is required for processing **.csv** files into **DataFrame** objects.
* Numpy is required for processing numrerical data, transforming and manipilating numerical data, and initiating functions regarding numerical data oeprations.
* Seaborn is required for visualising datasets and the relationships between data categories
* Sklearn is required to process ***Linear Regression**, evaluate the accuracy of the models, and to normalise the data.

### Dataset

<br>

The dataset used was sourced from **Kaggle**. The creator of this dataset used data provided by trusted sources.
The dataset can be downloaded at this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016). Alternatively, you can download the sourcecode and the dataset in the repository's **Releases** section.

## Rational

The purpose of this machine learning model is to predict the suicide rate per 100k people of one or more individuals based on their **age** and **gender** in relation with their country of origin. The processes with which the data was manipulated and the process with which the machine learning model was trained are explained in detail below.

### Data Wrangling

The dataset has multiple problematic data types from the from the perspective of a **Multivariate Linear Regression Model**.
